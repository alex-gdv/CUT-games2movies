# CUT-games2movies

I submitted this project for the module _Advanced Computer Vision_ at Durham University. 
I used [Contrastive Unpaired Translation](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation) (CUT) for style transfer between game and movie frames.
You can read the project report [here](acv_coursework.pdf).
